# Dev Things

_What I'm up to dev-wise_

---

Currently playing around with the following outside of work, all of which have been pretty fun üòé

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
- [WASM](https://rustwasm.github.io/book/what-is-webassembly.html)
- [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) and [Phoenix](https://www.phoenixframework.org/)
- [WebRTC](https://webrtcforthecurious.com/)

Additionally, here are some sites I've made üåê

- [typehere.lol](https://typehere.lol) ([source](https://github.com/nwgreenl/typehere.lol))
  - A simple preact app for typing and storing whatever you'd like (via local storage).
- [rgbtogether.com](https://rgbtogether.com) ([source](https://github.com/nwgreenl/rgbtogether))
  - A simple site that synchronizes background color updates every even second based on epoch.
