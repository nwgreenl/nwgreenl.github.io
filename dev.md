# Dev Things

*Where I'm at, where I'm trying to improve, and where I want to eventually be.*

---

### Current

I love working with web technologies, so that's where almost all my current experience and knowledge lies. This doesn't mean I'm an expert by any means, just that I feel comfortable with them!

> - HTML, CSS, SASS, Bootstrap, Material 
> - JS, Node, Express, React/Redux
> - PostgreSQL, T-SQL, MySQL, MongoDB
> - Mocha, Chai, Sinon

Outside of web dev, I also *love* reading through, updating, and writing docs, which is why this site is modelled after one!

I am very particular about docs though, and could go on and on about my preferences... but luckily, at my day job, I'm able to have my say in my org's docs guidelines and can scratch that itch as often as I'd like~

> - Markdown, YAML, JSON, XML
> - Layouts, Diagramming, Technical Translation, Practical/Trivial Code Examples

### In Progress

I am currently learning `go`, expanding my `python` knowledge, and finally picking up `GraphQL`.

> - I've learned to love a lot of things about go, but my original reason for learning it was as a replacement for node and as an intro into C syntax and statically typed programming in general.
> - Once upon a time I felt pretty comfortable on python, but I feel that I have let it slip as I practiced other languages. Since it's such a versatile language, I want to bring myself back up to speed.
> - GraphQL is one of those things I've always heard about but never used, but hey, better late than never!

### The Future

I would love to learn `C++` as I have a pipe dream of developing my own game some day... but no concrete plans as of yet.

I love dev work, but since working in tech I've gravitated towards Product Management, so I'm currently working towards that~
