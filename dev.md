# Dev Things

_What I'm up to professionally and recreationally_

Currently, my main interests are solving problems within the real-time communications and developer experience spaces ✌️

### Professionally

I love learning and working across various web and data tech stacks, and am _currently_ using the following at [work](https://www.shopify.com/careers), which are all pretty neat 🙌

> - Ruby on Rails
> - React w/ TypeScript
> - Go
> - GraphQL
> - MySQL
> - Kafka
> - GCP

### Recreationally

I'm currently playing around with [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and [WebRTC](https://webrtcforthecurious.com/) things, which has been pretty fun 😎
