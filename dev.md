### Current

I love working across various web and data tech stacks and am _currently_ using the following at [work](https://fulcrum.lever.co/), which are all pretty neat.

> - Node w/ TypeScript
> - DerbyJS
> - Express
> - ShareDB (OT)
> - MongoDB
> - PostgreSQL
> - Snowflake
> - Kafka

### In Progress

I'm currently trying to decide the next language I want to get super deep into. They are all a little different, so the list might seem kind of strange ðŸ˜…

> - Go
> - Rust
> - Kotlin
