# Dev Things

_Where I'm at, where I'm trying to improve, and where I want to eventually be._

### Current

I love working with web technologies & manipulating/interacting with data, so that's where the majority of my current experience and knowledge lies.

> - HTML, CSS, JavaScript
> - Node, TypeScript, Express
> - React, Redux, Saga
> - Material UI, SCSS, Styled Components (css-in-js)
> - Python, FastAPI, Flask
> - T/My/Postgre SQL, MongoDB

Outside of these, I also enjoy reading through, updating, and writing docs, which is why this site is modeled after one!

> - Markdown, YAML, JSON, XML
> - Layouts, Diagramming, Technical Translation, Practical/Trivial Code Examples

### In Progress

I am currently learning `Go` and finally picking up `GraphQL`.

> - I've learned to love a lot of things about go, but my original reason for learning it was as a replacement for node and an intro to C syntax and statically typed programming in general.
> - GraphQL is one of those things I've always heard about but never used, but hey, better late than never!

### The Future

I would love to learn `C++` as I have a pipe dream of developing my own game some day... but no concrete plans as of yet.
