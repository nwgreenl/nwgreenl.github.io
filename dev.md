# Dev Things

*Where I'm at, where I'm trying to improve, and where I want to eventually be.*

### Current

I love working with web technologies & manipulating/interacting with data, so that's where the majority of my current experience and knowledge lies.

> - HTML, CSS, SASS/LESS, Bootstrap/Material 
> - JS, Node, Express, React/Redux/Saga
> - Python, Pandas, NumPy
> - PostgreSQL, T-SQL, MySQL, MongoDB

Outside of web dev, I also *love* reading through, updating, and writing docs, which is why this site is modelled after one!

> - Markdown, YAML, JSON, XML
> - Layouts, Diagramming, Technical Translation, Practical/Trivial Code Examples

### In Progress

I am currently learning `go`, expanding my `python` knowledge, and finally picking up `GraphQL`.

> - I've learned to love a lot of things about go, but my original reason for learning it was as a replacement for node and as an intro into C syntax and statically typed programming in general.
> - Once upon a time I felt pretty comfortable on python, but I feel that I have let it slip as I practiced other languages. Since it's such a versatile language, I want to bring myself back up to speed.
> - GraphQL is one of those things I've always heard about but never used, but hey, better late than never!

### The Future

I would love to learn `C++` as I have a pipe dream of developing my own game some day... but no concrete plans as of yet.
