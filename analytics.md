### Current

I love gathering, analyzing, visualizing, and ultimately telling stories with data - both quantitative and
qualitative. I've been fortnuate enough to work with various product teams to support data-driven decisions and ensure the right projects are being prioritized.

> - SQL, ❄️
> - Python, Pandas, NumPy
> - Sheets, Sheets Query, Pivot Tables, Apps Script
> - Discovery & Validation Research

### In Progress

I am currently expanding my initial role's responsibilities to ensure that my SQL, Sheets, and Pandas/NumPy skills stay up to par!

> - I enjoy making friends with various data team members and helping them out with SQL queries, sheets, and scripts to support analysis and iniatives.
> - I make it a point to help other engineers write and/or improve the performance of their SQL queries.
> - I am currently writing a [web scraper](https://github.com/nwgreenl/poke-card-scraper) for the Official Pokémon TCG database and plan to do some fun analysis and visualizations with the resulting SQLite database.

### The Future

I would love to learn `R` at some point as I've seen the powerful things other's can do with it and seems super cool! I also wouldn't mind dwelving more into `Hive` and/or `Spark`.
