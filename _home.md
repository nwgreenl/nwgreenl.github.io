  res.status(200).send(resting.dev);
});

**_...Oh_**, hey there :wave:

I _totally_ wasn't just RESTing... <small>(get it?)</small>

Anyways, my name is Nick Greenlees, welcome to my humble abode on the world wide web.

There's not much here, but feel free to look around and enjoy your stay. You can even send me an [email](contact) if you'd like.
