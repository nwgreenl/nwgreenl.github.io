```javascript
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.status(200).send(resting.dev);
});
```

**_...Oh_**, hey there :wave:

I _totally_ wasn't just resting.

Anyways, welcome to my humble abode on the world wide web.

My name is Nick Greenlees, aka the RESTing dev... <small>(get it?)</small>

Please feel free to look around, enjoy your stay, and maybe even send me an [email](contact) if you'd like.
